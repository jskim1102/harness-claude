"""Shared helpers for the agent-team enforcement hooks.

Imported by task_created_format_check.py, task_completed_verify_gate.py and
teammate_idle_workcheck.py. Responsibilities:
  - parse the stdin JSON payload the harness delivers to a hook,
  - append an audit record to ~/.claude/logs/team-hooks.jsonl for every decision,
  - implement the documented exit-code contract: 0 = proceed, 2 = block + the
    stderr text is fed back as the reason.

Design rule for ALL hooks: FAIL OPEN. Any unexpected condition must resolve to
allow() — a hook bug must never be able to roll back a task, prevent a valid
completion, or trap a teammate. Enforcement is a guardrail, not a tripwire.

Adapted from aws-samples/sample-claude-code-agent-team for harness-claude.
Role tags adapted to our team: plan, design, dev, review.
